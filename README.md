## ⚙️ Working of the Project

The Digital Voting Platform works on a secure authentication-based voting mechanism.

• First, users register and their details are stored in the database.
• During login, credentials are validated with stored database records.
• After successful login, the user is redirected to the voting dashboard.
• The dashboard fetches the candidate list from the database.
• When the user votes, the system records the vote in the database.
• The system checks the voting status and prevents duplicate votes.
• All votes are stored for counting and result processing.

This ensures a transparent and secure online election workflow.
